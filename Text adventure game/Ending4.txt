You set Omar free.
It's a a feeling relief that finds you as you walk the streets back to your appartment. 
Thinking about how he feels, experiencing all the things, the sights, the sounds of the world around you. It makes you envy him for a little bit, that you can't also feel those things for the first time again.
A crash of a drone into the asphalt nearby pulls you suddenly from your daydream. Running over you see it's flashing lights die out and when you get to it you see that the round computer part sticking out of it has been cracked open, It's hull bent. It's Omar's core.
Quickly you raise your eyes up into the sky, and spot four drones, similar build, fly away. Fred must have alerted HQ or something, other security protocols maybe?
It's not your problem to fix.
It's too bad Omar won't live, but then again, who does?
