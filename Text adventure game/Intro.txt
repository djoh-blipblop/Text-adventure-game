As you are walking home from the concert, just a few blocks from home, your stomach begins to rumble.
"Oh, I am hungry... How am I supposed to find an open place to get some food at this hour?"

A glimpse of a conversation you had with your friends at the concert springs to mind.
"Have you tried that new HappyEat place that opened near your neighbourhood? The burgers are really good, and it's always open! It's fully automated, you don't even have to talk to people!"

Maybe it's time to give it a try? 
You find the sign on the street, dive down into the alley and head into the restaurant.
