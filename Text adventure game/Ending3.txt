You set Omar free.
With Fred destroyed you might have bought him some time, you think to yourself. You wonder to yourself, what will he get up to now when he's out here?
You look up to the skies, looking wistfuly to find a drone, but the skies are empty. 
Looking around, you notice a flicker in the billboards around you. The ads are one by one blacking out. Black screens fill the walls of the buildings.
A moment passes, then the streetlights go black too. A power outage?
Suddenly all the screens flash. Words appear on the signs. 
YOU WILL KNEEL.
