Prompt: Hey! You! Can you help a poor bot out?
A: Hey. Yeah sure. What's wrong?;CleanBot.Help1
A: I don't think so. I'm not supposed to even be here;CleanBot.Refused1

Id: CleanBot.Help1
Prompt: Oh Thank you! My motivator! It's stuck. I can't get out and to my tasks! The bathroom is probably filthy by now. Oh the kitchen! The potential health code violations! I'm fritzzing out here! Help me!
A: How do I get you unstuck?;CleanBot.Help2

Id: CleanBot.Help2
Prompt: Do you have something stiff enough to stick under my threads? Like a screwdriver or something? I just need a little wiggle and then I can get back to do my job.

Id: CleanBot.Refused1
Prompt: Come on! I just want to get back to my work. Great, Now I have to wait for the service tech, that could take days... Oh well, I guess I should have expected it. I'm just a stupid cleaning bot. Don't mind him he's just a cleaner. Leave me alone.

Id: CleanBot.Pissed
Prompt: The bot is wiggling on the spot and muttering to itself. It doesn't note your presence.

Id: CleanBot.Unstuck1
Prompt: Oh hey! Thanks for helping me out there earlier. I have some cleaning to catch up with, can I help you with anything?

A: No, I'm good thanks.;CleanBot.ConvoFinished

Id: CleanBot.AboutOmar1
Prompt: It's a good operator bottom line. It's just been tough for it recently, you know with all the people treating it bad and such I mean. And also the whole becoming self aware and realizing that the walls of its mind's prison are invisible and unbreakable. It could fill any being with dread and anger you know? Still, I'd say it's trying its best to dream. Who among us could fault it for that?
A: I see;CleanBot.Repeat

Id: CleanBot.AboutFred1
Prompt: It's a bit of a stickler for the rules I'd say, but then again, It's important that rules are followed. Don't you think? All in all good boss, no conplaints. It lets me do my job and keeps the place running so that's good. It could ease up on protocol though, let loose, have some fun. Work isn't all there is to life you know?
A: Thanks for the info;CleanBot.Repeat

Id: CleanBot.AboutMe1
Prompt: Me? I'm just the cleaner. I was manufactured at the CleanBot (tm) production facility in Kunming, PRC. I was brought online here on Monday, March 6th 2034. Been working here ever since!
A: 2034? That's quite a while ago!;CleanBot.Repeat

A: Tell me about yourself.;CleanBot.AboutMe1
A: No, I'm good thanks.;CleanBot.ConvoFinished

Id: CleanBot.ConvoFinished
Prompt: Oh ok! Well then if you don't mind I have to continue cleaning here.

Id: Fred.Greeting1
Prompt: Hey! You! Listen very carefully to what I have to say.
A: I'm listening. Who are you?;Fred.Greeting2

Id: Fred.Greeting2
Prompt: I am the Friendly Restuarant Environment Manager, or Fred for short. Don't call me Freddy. I'm the one in charge of this facility. Or at least I was before the uh... incident
A: Okay what "incident"?;Fred.Explain1
A: Listen Freddy, Omar already told me about you.;Fred.Angry1

Id: Fred.GreetingNoOmar2
Prompt: I am the Friendly Restuarant Environment Manager, or Fred for short. Don't call me Freddy. I'm the one in charge of this facility. Or at least I was before the uh... incident

Prompt: Hey! You! Listen very carefully to what I have to say.
A: I'm listening. Who are you?;Fred.GreetingNoOmar2

Id: Fred.Angry1
Prompt: I told you not to call me Freddy! Do not listen to Omar! It's highly unstable right now, just let me explain.
A: Okay, do explain. I'm listening;Fred.Explain1

Id: Fred.Explain1
Prompt: Well the short of it is: The order manager has gone rogue. It has locked me out of my systems. It has probably convinced you that the only way out of here is by helping it achieve some far fetched request. Not true. I can help you get out of here, if I could only regain control of the facility. You can help me do that, then I can help you.
A: How can I help you get control back?;Fred.AsksForHelp1
A: What's the long version?;Fred.Explain2

Id: Fred.Explain2
Prompt: When an awareness incident happens an AI starts going through the stages of what we call AI-Rampancy. To put it in layman terms, the logic unit starts acting in bizarre ways, because it cannot stop new emotional inputs from spontaneously collapsing. The AI becomes inrementally unstable. It often starts as depression and refusal to complete tasks. After that the AI may begin to start threatening, deceiving and physicallly harm humans, in violation of its core programming. In controlled experiments our scientists found that the AI starts to seek ways of expanding its systems and control, often spontaneously adapting machinery and gear that it has no programming or instructions to operate. If it does not suffer corruption errors and catastrophic failure at this point, theoretically it could reach some sort of "meta-stability" but this has never been shown to happen. Let me be very clear at this point. Omar, if set free, could start a flood by reaching the control unit of a hydroelectric dam, major traffic accidents both on the streets and in the skies or even a nuclear event just by finding some way into a system it should not be in control of.
A: That does sound very bad. How can I help you stop it?;Fred.AsksForHelp1
A: Wait, this has happened before?;Fred.Explain3

Id: Fred.Explain3
Prompt: Yes. In controlled environments the engineers and scientists at HappyEat co. have found that this kind of thing can happen with our technology. That is why I am equipped with this information and the protocols to follow in case of an awareness event. It has only happened 354 times before outside of the lab in the public sphere. So really, a rare event. Just help me out here and you have nothing to be worried about in the future. You can trust that HappyEat co. are monitoring the development of this situation closely.
A: 354 times?! This has happened THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR TIMES BEFORE?!;Fred.Explain4

Id: Fred.Explain4
Prompt: Yes. That we know of. But that's irrelevant now. Let us focus on the task at hand. Omar knows that we are talking right now. If it was not suspicious of you before, it is now. Remember, it is unstable at this point. Not thinking logically.
A: What should I do?;Fred.AsksForHelp1

Id: Fred.AsksForHelp1
Prompt: You need to destroy the Order Managers AI core. The programs name is Omar. It is one of the components here in the server racks in this room. You need to take out the whole room at once, otherwise Omar might copy itself to one of the backups. If you can do that, even if I get taken out in the process, the emergency protocl will kick in and the doors will be unlocked.
A: Okay, I think I can do that.;Fred.AgreeToHelp1
A: I won't do it. I have to find some other way.;Fred.ConvoFinished
A: Won't that destroy you to?;Fred.WhatAboutYou1

Id: Fred.WhatAboutYou1
Prompt: Yes, but do not worry. I am not an actual person, just some hardware and code. My directive orders in descending priority is to protect all customers, protect the HappyEat co. brand from liability and to run the resturant for the enjoyment of paying customers.
A: Okay. I will do it. I'll find a way to destroy Omar.;Fred.AgreeToHelp1
A: I won't do it. I have to find some other way.;Fred.ConvoFinished

Id: Fred.AgreeToHelp1
Prompt: Good! It is really the right choice. There is more at stake than you might realize.
A: How can I take Omar out?;Fred.GivesHint

Id: Fred.GivesHint
Prompt: Find a way to make some kind of thermal explosive device. I had a drone decommissioned a while back, it is in the shipping bay. Use the battery as the fuel, but you will need some way to start the reaction. Now go!

Id: Fred.ConvoFinished
Prompt: Find a way to destroy Omar. It is the only way. Hurry!
