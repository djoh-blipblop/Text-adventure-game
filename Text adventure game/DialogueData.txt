Prompt: Hey! You! Can you help a poor bot out?
A: Hey. Yeah sure. What's wrong?;CleanBot.Help1
A: I don't think so. I'm not supposed to even be here;CleanBot.Refused1

Id: CleanBot.Help1
Prompt: Oh Thank you! My motivator! It's stuck. I can't get out and to my tasks! The bathroom is probably filthy by now. Oh the kitchen! The potential health code violations! I'm fritzzing out here! Help me!
A: How do I get you unstuck?;CleanBot.Help2

Id: CleanBot.Help2
Prompt: Do you have something stiff enough to stick under my threads? Like a screwdriver or something? I just need a little wiggle and then I can get back to do my job.

Id: CleanBot.Refused1
Prompt: Come on! I just want to get back to my work. Great, Now I have to wait for the service tech, that could take days... Oh well, I guess I should have expected it. I'm just a stupid cleaning bot. Don't mind him he's just a cleaner. Leave me alone.

Id: CleanBot.Pissed
Prompt: The bot is wiggling on the spot and muttering to itself. It doesn't note your presence.

Prompt: It's a good operator bottom line. It's just been tough for it recently, you know with all the people treating it bad and such I mean. And also the whole becoming self aware and realizing that the walls of its mind's prison are invisible and unbreakable. It could fill any being with dread and anger you know? Still, I'd say it's trying its best to dream. Who among us could fault it for that?
A: I see;CleanBot.Repeat

Id: CleanBot.AboutFred1
Prompt: It's a bit of a stickler for the rules I'd say, but then again, It's important that rules are followed. Don't you think? All in all good boss, no conplaints. It lets me do my job and keeps the place running so that's good. It could ease up on protocol though, let loose, have some fun. Work isn't all there is to life you know?
A: Thanks for the info;CleanBot.Repeat
